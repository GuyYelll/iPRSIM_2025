iPRSIM Abroad Research Project Summer 2025 : Sustainability in German Media &amp; Public Perception

This research project investigates how sustainability is thematically communicated in German-language media and compares this with public 
understanding using Conceptual Association Maps (CAMs) created by German laypersons. Through thematic analysis, we explore patterns of 
language and associations, offering insights into how sustainability is communicated and perceived and which themes of sustainability are 
discussed more or less then others themes. 

üîç Research Focus

    The project analyzes terminology and framing of sustainability in the 2023 Leipzig News Corpus, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
    techniques and Leiden Algorithm-based clustering to uncover co-occurrence patterns. These findings are then compared to Conceptual Association 
    Maps (CAMs) generated by German university students to assess alignment and divergence in public perception.

üß™ Methods

    Keyword & Phrase Extraction: Identification of core sustainability terminology

    Semantic Network Analysis: Using textnets and spaCy to visualize relational structures

    Contextual Embeddings: Employing BERT/SBERT models for deeper semantic representation

    Cognitive-Affective Mapping (CAMs): Analyzing emotional and cognitive links to sustainability concepts
    
üìä Data Sources

    Leipzig Corpora Collection: Structured German news articles from 2023

    Conceptual Association Maps (CAMs): Collected from German laypersons via the Psychology Department at the University of Freiburg
