iPRSIM Abroad Research Project Summer 2025 : Sustainability in German Media &amp; Public Perception

Employing a thematic analysis, this project explores the variability of themes and associations of sustainability in German-language media and compares 
this framing to public perceptions captured via Conceptual Association Maps (CAMs) derived from German laypersons at the University of Freiburg.

üîç Research Focus

    Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), this study will analyze the 2023 Leipzig News Corpus to understand 
    how the various prinicples of sustainability is framed in German media. The Leiden Algorithm will be employed to cluster term co-occurrences, 
    identifying the dominant terminology and thematic structures in the text. Then  Compare findings to Conceptual Association Maps 
    (CAMs) derived from German layperson

üß™ Methods

    Text preprocessing: stop-word removal, lemmatization, language detection

    Keyword and phrase extraction

    Leiden Algorithm used to identify clusters of term co-occurrences, highlighting dominant terminology
    
    Semantic network analysis using textnets and spaCy

    Contextual embeddings (BERT/SBERT) for deeper semantic insights

    Cognitive-Affective Mapping (CAMs) to link emotion and sustainability concepts

üìä Data Sources

    Leipzig Corpora Collection: Structured German news articles

    CAMs of German laypersons collected from University of Freiburg Psychology dept. 

üìÖ Timeline
Project phases include data preprocessing, semantic analysis, CAM comparison, and final reporting ‚Äî planned for completion within the iPRSIM research program period.
