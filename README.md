iPRSIM Abroad Research Project Summer 2025 : Sustainability in German Media &amp; Public Perception

This project explores the variability of themes and associations of sustainability in German-language media and how such framing compares to 
public perceptions captured via Conceptual Association Maps (CAMs) derived from German laypersons at the University of Freiburg.

🔍 Research Focus

    Analyze terminology and framing of sustainability in the 2023 Leipzig News Corpus using Natrual 
    Language Processing (NLP) method and clustering by the Leiden Algorithm to form co-occurrences.
    Compare findings to Conceptual Association Maps (CAMs) derived from German layperson

🧪 Methods

    Text preprocessing: stop-word removal, lemmatization, language detection

    Keyword and phrase extraction

    Semantic network analysis using textnets and spaCy

    Contextual embeddings (BERT/SBERT) for deeper semantic insights

    Cognitive-Affective Mapping (CAMs) to link emotion and sustainability concepts

📊 Data Sources

    Leipzig Corpora Collection: Structured German news articles

    CAMs of German laypersons collected from University of Freiburg Psychology dept. 

📅 Timeline
Project phases include data preprocessing, semantic analysis, CAM comparison, and final reporting — planned for completion within the iPRSIM research program period.
